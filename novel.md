Prince Astralnomica looked to his left, then his right. His men-at-arms
were poised to attack, spears at the ready above their heads.

"What is the meaning of this?" Deltoro the third piped up. His cape,
draped from his shoulders to the floor, stirred back and forth as it's
wearer became more agitated.

"I put my faith in *you*, Deltoro the third. Your poor excuse for a raid
has let me down." Prince Astralnomica closed his fist, resting his face
against it atop his upwards arm. The sturdy gold plated throne he sat
upon glistened in the afternoon sun shining through the elaborate sun
roof.

"My leige, this incident was not one of fault. I beg of thee my lord,
demonstrate thy mercy!" the crowned Deltoro raised his open hands to the
prince, a look of worry in his eyes.

"Mine mercy has concluded." Astralnomica sat up in his chair, pointing
his finger at his subject.

**Do you\...**

Kill Deltoro

Spare Deltoro

*page 3*

"Kill him."

The men at arms lept into the air with their shields and their spears.
Held high above their heads, their spears penetrated the air downwards.

Deltoro cried out as he fell backwards, attempting to avoid the blades.
The nimble men-at-arms sandled feet trampled Deltoro on their descent,
as their sharp spears simultaneously pierced his clothed flesh. Deltoro
was dispatched in an instant by a dozen tips.

"You murderer!" Deltoro the third cried out towards his master. "Mine
father be not of this cause. Why must ye slay this innocent? If one is
to die, it is I!"

The crowd gathered in the king's chamber began a hushed murmur of
ill-content.

"Silence!" yelled Stollyarov, Prince Astralnomica's right hand man. "The
Prince's will is absolute. All hail Astralnomica!"

The crowd, incentivised by their primitive hiveminds, changed along with
Stollyarov.

"All hail Astralnomica!"

"My fury will abside. Live yet another day, but do not displease me."
The prince's punishment was stayed.

"Thank you, my leige!" Deltoro bowed his head and dropped to one knee,
before looking up to scold his second son.

"Deltoro the third, thy life be spared, doth thou not appreciate thine
luck?"

"My leige!" Deltoro the third dropped a tear from his eye as he bowed
his head with his hands at his side.

"This day be marked in your heart of hearts!" Stollyarov, the prince's
right hand man piped in. "Our lorde be merciful, even to the weak and
pathetic!"

Stolyarov pressed his gauntleted fist against his heart. "All hail
Astralnomica!"

The crowd clapped their hands and responded in furvur.

"All hail Astralnomica!"

### Abarroth the Foot

### 

It was a shunny day with sparkes of sweat marked on the plants in the
ground. The plethora of nuessential oils beaded on the forhead of the
character in question, **Abarroth the Foot**.

Abarroth stood in the clearing of the forest. His chest was wide as an
Ox was long. His naked muscular chest only covered by a thin strap which
affixed a quiver of arrows to his back. His left eye was in the middle
of a deep scar across his face, the eyeball glazed over with white due
to the damage. An animal's pelt covered his loins, and he wore wooden
sandals on his large feet. In his meaty hand, a mighty axe, forged from
the pristine metal found in the norther mountain lands.

Shunny beams illuminated the giant man, and his face expressed a never
ending thirst for domination. Unbeknownst to the villagers in
Huckelberry village, Abarroth the Foot gazed upon their humble abodes.

The Pitritch family farm had oozed nymph oil from the ground for
generations. The oil was seen as a minor nuisance, but not one without
it's benefits. Left unchecked, the oil would contaminate the corn,
leaving a slippery texture which was unpalatable even for the livestock.
Once harvested, the nymph oil could be sold for a high price in the
market.

Each new oil vein which arose from the soil had to be contained quickly.
Cisterns attached to pumps were fashioned on the veins, scattered
throughout the cornfields. The pumps had to be worked twice a day to
suck up the oil deposits from the ground and keep the corn clean. The
pump levers were difficult to actuate as they often created a
restrictive vaccum beneath the soil.

Markus Pickleton was working the pumps this morning. With every up and
down motion of the lever, the pump made a slurping sound like that of a
person slurping chunky soup from a bowl. Markus heaved the heavy lever
up and down. *SHLURP, SHLOP* the pump reverberated the sound of the
nymph oil being pulled from the earth.

Abarroth the foot breathed heavily as he looked to the corn farm from
among the trees. In the distance, Markus took a break from the pumps to
wipe a bead of sweat from his brow.

Abarroth's grip tightened on the girthy oak shaft of his axe. Shunny
light reflected on it's battered, sharpened blade as he took a step from
the forest.

Markus had already resumed pumping the lever. *SHLOSH, SHLORP* the
sounds echoed as the oil was forced into the cistern. Markus strained
himself as the lever went up and down, up and down.

Abarroth slowly approached Markus from the rear, casting a large
silouette shadow down. Markus paused with the pump's lever in the
upright position, as he curiously looked around for the source of the
blocked out shunny.

\
Markus turned his head with both hands still on the lever. Into his view
came the bare chest of the mighty Abarroth. Rising and lowering,
Abarroth's chest expanded and contracted with his breaths. Markus looked
up in shock to see the grinning Abarroth staring down at him.

"Uhh!" Surprised Markus let go of the pump lever, taking a step back.
"Who are you?" Markus struggled to keep his voice from quivering.

Abarroth said nothing, and only shifted his damaged gaze down to the
pump. Using his free hand, Abarroth the Foot effortlessly pumped the
lever down and up. *SQWEEEE, SQUOOO! *the pump's pitch was heightened as
the giant man worked the mechanism.

"Hey, you're pretty good at that!" Markus blurted at the sight.

Abarroth's grin widened as he threw the lever downwards one last time.
*SQEEEE! *the pump squeaked and Abarroth took an aggressive step towards
Markus.

"What do you want?" Markus stepped back once more, raising his hand up
between him and Abarroth.

Abarroth raised his axe as he closed the gap between he and Markus.

"Foot!" Abarroth's booming voice bellowed, as his axe fell atop Markus.

Nymph oil dripped from a leaky gasket as grunts and the sound of ripping
flesh was heard.

### Blotter Rot

### 

Three days had passed and Kim had already began to worry about her
brother. His voyage was only scheduled to last two, but he had not yet
returned to Ardenvoire.

"I'm going to look for Dirk!" Kim yelled to her mother as she grabbed a
hard bun from the kitchen.

"Okay dear, be careful!" The mother's voice echoed from within the home.

Kim bolted out the front door, slamming it behind her. Kim wore slim
black athletic shorts, white tank top and a backpack. The cobblestone
street of the town was busy with people as the morning shunny blistered
from above. A neighbor threw a bucket of dirty water from the second
story window as Kim's pitter pattering bare feet ran through the streets
towards the town square.

"G'morning, Kim!" Old man Pete said, the air from his mouth blowing his
bushy white mustache. He had a bald spot on his head, atop a ring of
frizzy white hair. He wore brown corduroy overalls and a blue apron.
"Can ya' bring me some more of that fine woodworm?" he inquired, pausing
from nailing board on the exterior wall of his absinthe shop. He gave an
OK sign.

"Not right now, gramps, I've gotta find Dirk!" Kim ran in place with her
hands gripping the shoulder straps of her canvas backpack. Her bare arms
barely moved as her white tank top fluttered with her motion. Kim hopped
back and forth as she eyed the damage on Pete's storefront.

"Rowdy customers again?"

"Third time this week!" The hunched over man replied.

"Ah, you're too nice. Quit handing out free samples, you old fart!" Kim
continued jogging in place as her perky red hair waved.

"Heh heh, some people ne'r learn!" Old man pete rubbed his bald head
before reaching into his pocket. "Here, take this."

The elderly man extended a small green glass bottle full of clear liquid
to Kim.

"What's this?" Kim reached with one hand as she moved closer, her bare
feet still slapping the cobblestone.

"A special elixir. Drink it to restore your vitality!" The man smiled
from ear to ear.

\
"You idiot, I'm only 16!" With a look of distaste, Kim scolded the
alcohol shop owner.

Old man Pete laughed.

"Nothing to worry about, this 'n is alcohol free!" The white haired man
waved his hand in front of his face. "Drink up if the need arises!"

Kim's expression changed to relieved, as she removed her backpack and
stowed the small bottle within.

"Oh then, I'm off!"

The two waved as Kim leaned forward, resuming her speedy run. Kim passed
under an arch which spanned between the two sides of the narrow street,
followed by a leftward turn down a narrow cobblestone slope. Housing and
shops were on either side, with steps leading up to their entrances. A
ringing bell was heard as a customer entered one of the stores.
Discernible chatter echoed off the walls in increasing amounts as Kim
neared the epicenter of crowded populace.

The cobblestone street widened into the town square, where the
marketplace was in full sing. An ass pulled a cart of alfalfa through
the town as it's wide hatted owner led the way. A constable argued with
a drunken man. A fish seller shouted the daily deal.

Kim approached a vegetable stand, exchanging small metal coins for a
handful of potatoes. She tossed the roots in her backpack before running
towards the edge of town. Through another stone arch spanning between
buildings, Kim crossed through and entered farmland. The cobblestone
road transitioned into dirt, and wide brim hatted farms could be seen on
either side tending to their golden wheat crops swaying gently in the
breeze.

Kim's small breasts jiggled a bit on every step, but only a little
because she had an A cup. Also her running form was really good as she
ran barefoot, and this was the age before cell phones and tennis shoes.
Thanks to being barefoot, Kim was forced to use her feet muscles to
their maximum potential. It was healthier that way because the lack of a
shoe sole meant Kim's feet would employ their natural springiness, and
there was no heel striking to speak of. 100% foot utilization, with a
balanced posture and the front section of the feet near the toes making
first contact.

Kim kept running until the farmland faded away,. and the forest began.
Dirk had planned on taking a shortcut through the Willow forest, which
Kim had not been keen on. Dirk went anyway, and now more than ever Kim
wanted to yell at Dirk.

"I told you so!" Kim spoke aloud with her hands gripping her backpack
straps.

Kim slowed her job as the dirt road camee to an end, and a narrow beaten
path weaved through the large sprawling willor roots. Kim's movements
became more calculated as she stepped through the woods. The shunny was
obscured by the tall willow trees, and a certain coolness feeling
increased as Kim proceeded into the shaded sticks.

Kim stepped over thick dark green vegetation as large grubworms squirmed
through dirt around the base of the trees. The

Dod you know that leaves don't rot? It's actually the little critters
like ants and spiders that eat the leaves. Leaves by themselves don't
decay. Intersting, right? Another thing that doesn't rot is pork rinds.
No joke, they only rot once they've been cooked, which is why you see
them in stores and the like.

"Plebian! Doest thou not heed my words????" Nasus beckoned.

"Nai, my master ist located nearby in various different other facility."
Blebboth barked back.

"Slave. Ye cannot break my sound barrier."

"Nai, yest fortitude be unworthy to mine gratitude."

Nasuss ground his tteeth together as he became acutely angry.

"DO YE NOT RECOGNIZE GEOMETRY???" Nasus was losing his shit.

"E, but only Math.PI." Blemouth's sarcastic tone was palpable.

"SEX. Right now." Nasus' eyes widened at the thought.

"Lorde, my gills are moist." Blemoth spread his neck meat following the
prompt.

"I'm coming!" Nasus's large staff pulsated in unison with it's repeating
extension.

"Too soon!" Blemoth's gills contracted on their own.

"SEXXX, it is yesteryear.." Nasus's Unusually Large Rod went limp, and
it's engorging pattern ceased.

"I'm sorry, I didn't think this would happen." Nasus set his gold
scepter aside and buried his snout in his hands.

"It's okay, we'll get to Valhalla next time." Blemouth rubbed some creme
on his oxygen absorbent slits.

\#\# Goat in the creel: Walk together attitude.

The tip of a fishing pole was pulled by the line on a warm summer day.

"I got one! I got one!" Ippo, a boy with missing teeth and a straw hat,
white shirt and shorts with wooden sandals was surprised as he leaned
back. Holding his fishing rod with both hands, he begun to reel in his
line.

"Wow, that's the first bite all day!" Sugaru looked over with a
surprised look, mouth wide open. The straw in his mouth almost falling
out. His black kimono swayed in the wind as his socked and sandled feet
dangled from the dock. His short orange hair swayed a bit from the
breeze, and his distant eyes looked over to Ippo. "I wish I could catch
a fish!

"It's not something everybone can do, you know!" The young boy
showboated. He stood up from the dock, and vigorously reeled in his
line. The look on his face became more focused as he perced his lips
together. The fishing rod bent over as he continued to wind his reel.

"It's a big one!" Ippo leaned away from the line, and took one step
back. "It's a big one alright!"\

As Ippo reeled, his fishing rod bent further. It strained almost to the
point of snapping, as the line in the water moved away from the dock.
Ippo couldn't help but be pulled forward by the line.

"Whoah!" Sugaru shouted, dropping his own fishing rod as he grabbed
Ippo's. "Hold on tight!"

The two boys struggled to hold the fishing rod upright. For several
moments, the line moved back and forth as the creature below struggled
to break free.

"Keep reeling!" Sugaru urged Ippo, who had placed both hands on the
fishing rod's handle.

"I know, I know!" Ippo resumed his reel, winding the lever it quickly.
The mechanism was strained under the force of the fish.

Only it wasn't a fish. The hook rose to the water's surface, and with
it, only more water. As the metal hook reached the surface, the water
surface itself began to stretch upwards as if a thick jelly. The hook
itself was stuck to the clear water, as if the water surface itself was
alive and struggling!

"What the hell!?" Sugaru blurted first. Ippo with his hand still on the
winding mechanism, froze in shock and disbelief.

"What is that?" Ippo managed to speak.

The water's surface, as if a thick skin, was pierced by the hook and
being pulled from the pond below. Like the top of a circus tent,
perfectly round with a stretched high point in the center. The pinched
water surface held still.

Ippo and Sugaru paused to look at each other with eyes wide open. With
their shoulders pressed up against each other and the fishing rod
gripped tightly in their hands.

The water moved. Once again as if alive, the caught water surface tried
to free itself by pulling away from the hook. The fishing line was
pulled, and the rod bent further. The water surface stretched, but
remained tethered to the hook.

Sugaru snapped out of his trance and acted on instinct.

"Ippo, Reel it in! Pull! Pull!"

With a look of determination, Ippo wound the reel quickly. The water
stretched further and further, until it looked like either the fishing
pole or the water surface were about to snap.

And something snapped. The entire pond, as if anchored to the water
surface, gave way. The entire pond, as if a giant drop of water, sprung
into the air as the springiness of the fishing pole snapped the water
upwards.

"Ahhh!" Ippo and Sugaru's shock was palpable as the giant bead of water
rose to it's apex, with the fishing line becoming slack. As it slowed at
the top of it's arc, the contents of the pond could be seen inside. An
old boot floated within the liggling bead as it began to fall towards
Ippo and Sugaru.

"Look out!" Sugaru pulled Ippo to the side who was still gripping the
reel with a look of shock on his face. The straw in Sugaru's mouth fell
out. Sugaru pulled Ippo up the dock towards the bank at the edge of the
dry pond just in time to see the giant bead of water make contact with
the dock where the two had just been standing. The bead of water pressed
down under it's own gravity, flattening downwards against the dock like
a flappy pancake. Recoiling under the water's own massive surface
tension, the water bead bounced upwards with a loud bloop.

The pond water bead bounced one more time, this time with a softer sound
and reaching a lower height. The bead's bounce lost it's momentum and
it's shiny surface slowed, jiggling and glistening in the shunny.

Ippo and Sugaru exchanged looks again, both of their hands still
gripping the fishing pole. As the bead of water sat on the dock with
it's edges rolling over the side, hook still intact on the surface,
Sugaru released his grip on the pole and the two approached the
phenomenon slowly.

Sugaru approached first, as if to shield his younger friend. Ippo reeled
in his line as he came closer.

Sugaru removed a sandal and poked the watery mass with it. The water's
surface gave way, pressing inwards around the sandale. Sugaru removed
the sandle and felt it with his hand.

"It's dry." Sugaru curiously rubbed the wooden sandle.

"I'm going to mount this water creature on my wall!" Ippo proclaimed
loudly as the embedded hook met the last ring of his pole.

"You idiot. You can't mount water." Sugaru said as he placed his sandle
back on his foot.

"But this isn't normal water!" Ippo barked back, looking up at Sugaru.

The surface of the water rippled where Sugaru had pulled his sandal
from. A few bubbles could be seen deep within.

"Something about this doesn't add up. I think we should have a chat with
the village elder."

"That's fine with me, go get him!" Ippo demanded.

"What if that thing decides to come alive?" Sugaru reasoned. "You go.
I'll watch the water blob."

"No way! This is my catch. I'm not leaving it."

"It might try to drown you!"

"I'll kick it in the face!" Ippo quickly replied.

"Ok, don't let your guard down!"

Sugaru jogged up the dock over the dry pond, away from Ippo and the
giant wiggling water bead.

Gripping his fishing rod, Ippo held a hunched over pose and concentrated
on the shimmering blob. A moment of silence passed. A flock of noisy
birds flew overhead.

"What are you, some kind of water demon?" Ippo filled the silence with
his question.

The water blob vibrated, sending a ripple through it's skin.

"Whoah!" Ippo jumped back, arms extending away from his body as his
hands remained grasped on the pole. The hair on the back of his neck
stood erect.

Another moment of silence passed while Ippo's view remained fixed on the
water blob. A gentle breeze blew through the nearby tree branches.

"Hey!" Ippo yelled again to calm his nerves. "Water demon!"

The water blob vibrated again in response, this time with a greater
movement.

"Ahah! So you are alive!" Ippo blurted as his hands gripped tighter on
the fiberglass rod. "Do you have a name?"

Silence. The ripples on the water blob dissipated and it's surface
returned to a gentle roll.

"Pfft, who am I kidding. It's not like a water demon could talk." Ippo
rolled his eyes.

The water blob responded again, violently sending ripples across it's
surface as it intensely vibrated. It's sagging edges spilling over
either side of the dock became taut as the water blob raised it's
height, as if to stand up from laying down. Ippo's eyes widened as the
embedded hook moved upward with the raising water.

"H.. Hey now, Mr. water, there's no need to get upset!" Ippo tried to
keep his voice from cracking under the circumstances.

The water blob's surface transitioned from vibration and ripples to a
flowing movement from bottom to top. It's previously spherical shape
became like an elongated egg, wider at the bottom and narrower at top.
The water blob towered over Ippo, more than three times his height. The
sun's light became obscured by the dark blue water within, casting a
shadow on Ippo and the dock below.

"Demon\... am not!" A booming voice resonated from the water's surface
as a large mouth formed above the hook. As the voice emanated from the
water, the hook stuck in the water blob's lower lip moved up and down.

Eyeless, earless, but mouthed, the water creature waited for Ippo's
response.

Ippo's arms were raised as if to shield himself from an impending
attack. Such attack didn't occur as the water creature stood it's
ground. It's sides flowed from top to bottom, and it's large mouth hung
open. The hook in it's lower lip remained, with the fishing line taut
from it to Ippo's rod.

"Ok, not a demon then. So what are you?" Ippo questioned the creature.

The flowing waves of water accelerated a bit as the water creature
opened it's mouth to speak.

"Spirit\... am." The water creature spoke with burdened speech.

"Spirit? Pond Spirit?"

"Pond spirit\... Am not."

"Ocean spirit?" Ippo continued to guess.

"Ocean? There\... I was. Ocean spirit.. Am not."

"Ok, so you're some kind of water spirit." Ippo was getting impatient.

"Water.. Spirit\... Am."

"Did we wake you?"

"Wake\... Yes."

"We have been fishing here for years. Why did you wake now?"

The water spirit began to shake. Water surface with the likeness of
clenched teeth formed between it's water lips. The hook kept it's place
with the lower lip, and the fishing line between it and the rod
quivered.

"Evil\... EVIL!"

The water spirit's voice boomed louder than ever before, blowing a burst
of air which flapped Ippo's hat and clothing in the wind. Ippo moved one
hand from his fishing pole to his hat to keep it from flying off.

"Evil?"

Sugaru came running from the village direction. Ahead of the shaman,
Sugaru stopped and pointed to the dock.

"Over here, master Jinjin!"

The master was almost half as short as Sugaru and wore a similar black
kimono. Jinjin held a straight wooden cane in one hand, and his other
hand moved his straw hat out of his eyes to unobstruct his view of the
dock.

"Oh my heavens!" Master Jinjin gasped as he gazed upon the large water
spirit on the middle of the dock.

The old man's movements were invigorated as he pulled off his straw hat
and tossed it aside, picked up his cane and dashed towards the dock.
Jinjin reached Ippo and immediately dropped to his knees. The shaman
placed his cane at his side and bowed his head. In a show of humility,
his forehead made contact with the heavily weathered wooden dock, where
he held his position for several seconds.

Ippo confusedly looked down at Shaman Jinjin, back at the water spirit
above, then again at Jinjin.

"Pay your respects!" Sugaru's voice came from behind as he approached
Ippo and Jinjin. Sugaru pulled Ippo's straw hat off of his head, then
with his hand on Ippo's hair, pressed downwards.

"Fine, fine!" Ippo held his fishing pole firmly in his left hand as he
knelt down, guiding himself downwards with his right hand.

Sugaru placed Ippo's hat aside as he followed suit. With knees against
the dock, he and Ippo bowed their heads towards the water spirit.

Master Jinjin was the first to rise. Using his cane, he stood up slowly.

"Oh great spirit, please forgive these young ones for their disturbance!
They are too stupid for your graciousness." Master Jin rose his arms
towards the water spirit as he spoke.

"Hey, take that back, you old bastard!" Ippo yelled, sitting up and
jumping back on his feet.

"Maybe if you'd hurry up and become my pupil, you'd gain some brain
cells!" Master Jinjin spoke with his eyes closed, both hands resting on
his cane.

Sugaru stood slowly.

"We've been over this, I'm not going to be like Sugaru and wear those
stupid hakama!"

"Hey, Unamori aren't stupid!" Sugaru joined the argument.

"Yes they are! They're for old men who ride ponies!"

"What? Samurai wore hakama!"

"Don't care. They're stupid."

Ippo and Sugaru locked gazes as a bolt of electricity seemed to zap
between the two.

"Settle down." Jinjin interrupted. "Why don't we see to our guest?"

The two boys looked up at the water spirit, it's dark blue stature
gently flowing.

"What now, Sensei?" Sugaru asked.

"Let's boil it down and put it in a jar!" Ippo excitedly butted in.

Shaman Jinnin lifted his cane and bonked Ippo on the head.

"Oww!" Ippo reeled back and rubbed his head with one hand.

One time I went to Kumoricon and it was a lot of fun, to say the least.
To say more, I did all sorts of things I never would have thought I'd
do. For example, I told a group of strangers my goals for next con\-- I
want to master Wotagei! Wotagei is a set of dance moves that can be done

\#\# Draknok the Defiler

D.t.D. for short. Draknok ravaged the hills of Westnoth for years on
end, never ceasing his brutal attacks. Every poor village who
encountered Draknok was wiped from the earth in a bloody blitz. Bodies
strewn left and right, Draknok left no survivors behind, and mercilessly
defiled each one of them by carving his initials into their foreheads.

Draknok carried a long hallebarde. Besides it's razor sharp edge, the
blade was surprisingly ill-maintained. Years of battle damage left it's
metal in poor shape. The blade had jagged edges, deep scars,
discoloration, and even rust. More surprisingly, the thing didn't fall
apart when he routinely defiled village after village.

Ok, so Draknok wasn't the smartest of villains. One of the oldest tales
spoken by the oldfolk of Westnoth was that of Draknok's fatal flaw\--
his inability to solve riddles. This was the best known mitigation of
D.t.D.'s wrath, and the one thing townspeople in his sight could use to
delay or completely shun the attacks.

"What gets wetter as it dries?"

\... was a surefire way to have D.t.D. dazed and confused for hours.
Draknok would work desperately to solve the riddle by counting his
fingers or consulting scripture.

Of course, this trick could only work once per riddle, so the most
prepared of townsfolk would always have a few fresh riddles on hand.

\#\# Madeline Faust

Some people are just painfully average. This is the story of Madeline
Faust, homemaker.

Homemaker is such an ambiguous term. It's literally two words mushed
together, "home", and "maker." What attributes constitute one who is
labelled as such? A construction worker who builds a house? A doll
collector who adds a tiny table and furniture to their toy's abode? As
you can see, the word can be stretched, strained, and and applied in a
thin coat to many circumstances.

Madeline was the kind of person who would drop everything to make sure a
stranger walking down the road had a proper meal. She would withhold her
spending on leisurely activities for months to make sure she could
afford top-notch holiday gifts for her family.

Madeline made a house a home, even when it rained. This makes no sense I
can't relate pl0x nerf hardworking women.

Ok so this isn't a novel anymore, but a summary of my Kumoricon 2018
trip. I'm doing this because I gotta write a lot in a little amount of
time. Writing fantasy sometimes becomes boring, I get stuck for hours. I
need a session that is pure flow! What I really want to write right now
is what happened at Kumoricon because it's in the back of my head and it
wants to get out! Names listed have been changed to protect privacy.

I met at Allison's house on a Friday morning. Both of us were between
jobs so we didn't have to work. We planned to arrive at about 6PM, pick
up our badge, and catch some of the evening activities.

Allison's small dog barked non-stop when I saw her house for the first
time. His breed is very loud! Apparently he liked me though. Allison's
collection of anime, manga, figurines and other otaku merchandice was
the most impressive I've ever seen. Her method of organizing them by
stacking on shelves gave me inspiration for my own collection.

We took Allison's small sedan rather than my gas guzzling truck. We
headed out and hopped on I-90 westbound. Allison kept noting the ugly
scenery, and I had to agree. We left the trees around Spokane for dry
desert hills. We turned southwest around Ritzville, missing my favorite
part of the trip between Spokane and Seattle\-- The Wanapum Lake
crossing at Vantage.

More dry terrain in that area. "Oooh, a prison!" seemed to be the
highlight as we passed through southern Washington.

We stopped at a gas station to top-up Allison's car. Splitting expenses
as planned, I got out of the car to fill up. Surprisingly, we were
already in Oregon, which meant it's illegal to fill up our own gas!
Luckily I'm slow, so I dodged that potentially awkward moment.

Finally the terrain changed for the prettier as we neared Portland. The
lushness I remember and love from living in Eugene came into view as the
highway joined the Columbia River.

We saw lots of homeless camps in Portland. This evoked lengthy
conversations between Allison and I on the subject. I'll leave it at
that.

We had to drive through Portland to reach our hotel in Beaverton.
Traffic on highway 26 was intense. Each time we passed, there was either
stop and go traffic, accidents, or both. I chose to stay in Beaverton
due to receiving a great rate thanks to my older sister's connections.

Staying in Beaverton was a minor regret, as it put us further from the
convention center. It may have been less expensive for us to spend a
little more to stay in downtown Portland right near the con rather than
spend extra money on ride sharing, and burn extra time waiting for
traffic to flow.

There was a silver lining to staying in Beaverton\-- the food. We ate at
Thailand Restauraunt which had pumpkin spice curry that blew my mind.
Another night we ate at Sweet Tomatoes all you can eat salad bar which
had incredibly fresh ingredients, unique dressings, and delicious vegan
minestrone soup.

After we arrived at our hotel and checked in, we ate dinner then hit the
busy highway 26 again on our way to the convention center. We arrived
ten minutes before registration closed, where we received our badges,
event guides, and got oriented with the convention center.

Straight away we looked at upcoming Friday events that we would still be
able to attend. We went to the first panel that looked interesting,
"Musical Animes, It's All About the Men."

Let me say that I misinterpreted the title of that panel. I was
expecting a look at idol anime with male target audiences. What I got
was man-on-man romantic subtones in primarily male musical animes. "DUN
DUN DUN!", as the panelists would say. You just had to be there. They
were very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject, covering every
fictional band in their favorite musical anime series.

In the spirit of good music, I briefly checked out My EDM Academia, the
music program on Friday.

We didn't stay long at the convention center on Friday, because we were
so tired from the six or seven hours of driving earlier in the day.

We went back to the hotel and rested, with the plan of waking up at 7AM
with time to shower, dress up, and head to the convention center for
some 9AM panels.

Our plan flopped, as we were both too tired to get up on time. We ended
up getting up at around 10AM, decided to forgo the costumes, and head to
the convention center to see what we could do.

My current obsession which exists beyond the spacetime of Kumoricon is
Vocaloid music. Hatsune Miku is my favorite, and I can't wait to see her
live in concert again. This obsession drove me to see the panel, Happy
Hyper Moe Kawaii Music Time, which showcased popular music fitting said
theme. Miku had a nice spotlight with a MikuExpo 2018 Euro Tour video.

A guy a couple seats ahead of me wore an impressive Happi Jacket
featuring his idol from the anime Love Live. This wasn't the last time
I'd see him and his jacket.

The next panel I attended was Intro to Fanfic, where a unique elementary
school teacher taught us common Fanfic, terminology, popular websites
for sharing stories, and more. As a hobbyist writer I got a lot out of
that panel.

Next I checked out one of the most magical places in all of Kumoricon,
the Kumorimarket! I got sucked into the fantastic artist alley where I
bought a print of an artist's interpretation of the popular MitchieM
song, Ohedo Julia-Night（大江戸ジュリアナイト）.

I also purchased three shirts, two of the Hatsune Miku variety, and one
Ghost in the Shell. And a Miku plushie\... And a Weiss Shwarz trial
deck. As expected, I spent too much money!

One of my favorite panels was on Sunday, entitled, Surviving Life After
Con. This panel hit home for me, as I have experienced acute depression
in the days after previous conventions. Luckily, post Kumoricon wasn't
nearly as bad before because I didn't have a job I loathed to go back to
the following days!

Surviving Life After Con was very good for me because it gave me a
chance to open up to fellow con-goers, introduce myself, share my goals
for next con, and get to know a few of the audience on a one-on-one
basis. None of which I would have done on my own without the panelist's
prompts!

One of the things I saw in the event book that I was the most excited
for was Ghost Neko's Purranormal Maid Cafe. Unfortunately, I put off our
visit to the Maid Cafe until the last day of the con, when the cafe was
terribly unprepared.

I waited an hour in line. Upon ordering food, the staff was unsure of
whether or not they had any vegan food options. Ordering and paying for
food was done before entering the room by the way, which was very
confusing. It wasn't cheap either, with the two of our orders coming out
to \$50.

When we finally got to our table, we were completely ignored by the
staff! Twenty minutes passed before Allison got up and talked to the
staff at the entrance. The gentleman who took our order at the entrance
decided to be our butler, as all other maids continued to ignore us. We
receive an apology and he began to serve our food. To my pleasure,
coffee was served black. Allison on the other hand wanted cream and
sugar, but wasn't given the option. Our butler spilled two soup and
coffee on the tablecloth, as he seemed nervous about Allison who was
becoming increasingly upset.

I was upset as well, as I was served a roll with butter after specifying
my vegan diet. I wanted to walk out and ask for a refund, but Allison
seemed set on staying. I ignored my food and gulped my coffee,
desperately hoping it would help me reach a better mood.

The coffee worked it's magic, and I dug into the food, minus the
buttered roll. It was the worst tasting food from the entire weekend. It
had been sitting in the room with us waiting for maids and butlers to
serve it for who knows how long, but it was filling and it helped turn
the mood around.

Even though he had made several mistakes, our butler turned out to be a
cool dude. After inquiring about our con experiences and determining
that we were Sword Art Online fans, he revealed to us his Laughing
Coffin tattoo on his right arm, a spitting image from the villainous
characters in the anime. He received major props from me for his
passion.

Our butler noted a purchase of an ecchi longboard deck from the FAKKU!
booth in the Kumorimarket, something I might have done under the right
circumstances. To our surprise, the booth erroneously sold him the deck;
that model was intended to come to market much later! The booth had
since taken down remaining inventory of that deck for Kumorimarket, yet
he remained with his now very special pre-release deck!

Finally, a Polaroid with our mysterious table mate Strider and our
Butler. More mistakes as the camera refused to take a photo due to lack
of film. The cafe was a train wreck in my book, but I remember it well
and laugh about it now. Future visits to similar events will come
earlier in the convention, not the very last session of the very last
day!

I really enjoyed the Sake tasting panel on Saturday night. Our panelist,
Marcus guided us through a grand selection of six different sake,
including an extraordinary slideshow which highlighted how sake is
painstakingly made, and the differences between varieties. My favorite
ended up being Eternal Embers (Junmai grade) from a brewery in Ishikawa.

This document is now a novel!

Princess Haldron looked down at her subjects as she stood above her ruby
red upholstered oak throne. Haldron had long blonde twintails flowing
from under her jeweled crown. A look of distaste was in her eyes as she
held her golden scepter with her bare arm extending from within her red
cape.

"sdf"

\"Snip, snip!\", Joey took the first shot. The bullet ravaged the
ubrella\'s water resistant coating, followed by it\'s juicy polyethylene
interior. It proceeded further, penetrating the air between the steel
umbrella\'s folding skeleton. The bullet made a quick glaze of the
metallic spine, spattering hot metal in Municipal\'s face before
continuing into the brick wall with a clack.

\"Oh, shit!\" Municipal screamed, reacting to the loud noise and fiery
assault to his face. He closed his eyes tightly and turned away from the
heated spray. The umbrella in his arms dropped, suspended only by it\'s
retaining wrist strap as his focus was jarred away from the raining sky
above.

\"What the hell is wrong with you?\" Snoot angrily reverberated at Joey
through his long snout. The umbrella\'s side had a fresh new hole ripped
through one side by the speeding bullet, but both knew that wasn\'t
enough.

Municipal wiped his face as a bead of rain splashed on his hand.
Confused at the ruckus, he looked heaven ward, as the top of his
dangling umbrella swayed back and forth.

Joey looked up over his scope at the target, while Snootleberry kept his
face fixed to his binoculars.

\"We\'re in luck.\" Snoot chirped with a slight whistle in his snooter.

\"He hasn\'t realized we\'re shooting his umbrella yet.\"

\"Thank Got\", Joey replied, bringing his scope\'s objective back into
view.

\"Adjust windage plus two ticks\" Snoot spoke quickly, his mind on the
misson once again.

\"Copy. Adjusting wind pos two ticks\" Joey spoke with his dominant eye
still peering through his high power scope, while his right hand left
the trigger to adjust the scope\'s rightmost knob.

Joey\'s dirty yet muscular fingers showed through his fingerless wool
gloves as the rain pranced down on his bare head. The knob was precisely
torqued clockwise, the scope making two small clicks.

Joey returned his right hand to the gun\'s handle, his finger resting
gently on the trigger as he re-positioned the gun to it\'s new firing
position.

Municipal looked from left to right, then shook his head. \"Can this day
get any more weird?\"

\"Umbrella down. Take the shot.\" Snoot\'s speech impediment kicked in
on the \'sh\', the unexpected phonemes causing Joey to smile.

\"Gladly. Shot out!\" Joey pulled the trigger\...

\# This novel is now a Squad guide!

Squad is a multiplayer tactical first person shooter which emphasizes
realism, teamwork and communication. An average game consists of finding
a server, joining a squad, and immediately assisting that squad in their
objectives.

To be successful in said squad, you must coordinate, communicate, and
conquer. A squad which coordinates attacks, communicates by calling out
spotted enemy positions, and conquers by applying efficient deadly force
will vastly outperform a squad who does not.

Microphones are a necessity in Squad, which boasts an accurately
simulated two way radio network. There are three networks in Squad. One,
the command net, in which squad leaders can talk with other squad
leaders. Two, the squad net, in which squads of 9 members can
communicate with eachother. Finally, local net, in which any team member
can speak with any nearby team member.

Because of this radio network, squad leaders often have the best idea of
the current happenings in a battlefield. It is up to squad leaders to
coordinate their efforts. For example, it would behoove a squad leader
to communicate to other squad leaders the next action his squad will be
taking, to prevent multiple squads from pooling resources on a single
capture point when the state of the capture point only warrants one
squad's attention.

Squad is not an easy game to play. Squad contains realistic mortar
cannons, dozens of small arms weapons, armored personnel carriers,
supply and transport trucks, medic equipment, deployable heavy weaponry
and defenses to name a few. Each of these game assets could require
their own special training if one wanted to become proficient in each.
It's not uncommon for new players to be very poor Squad gamers until
they have invested dozens of hours into learning the game.

Leading a squad is a meta game of it's own. As a squad leader, you are
responsible for 8 other gamers, all of which may have an idea of their
own on how to lead the squad.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#1. Do not take orders from squadmates.

As squad lead, it is your duty to issue orders. If you take even one
order from a squad mate, you might as well hand squad leader over to
that mate. If chain of command breaks down, your squad will spend more
time on figuring out who's boss than working to win the game. Respect
the role as Squad leader. Lead or die.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#2. Do not tolerate insubordination.

If you squad lead long enough, you will find players who dislike your
leadership style. You will find players who ignore your orders. Although
there are realistic elements in Squad, this is still a game, and nobody
is forcing a player to be in your squad.

Players who cause problems for chain of command should be asked to form
their own squad where they can lead themselves, or be kicked.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#3. Ask first, order second, kick third.

As squad leader, you will quickly become busy with juggling many tasks
at once. Creating rally points, ordering troops to attack points,
calling for supplies, coordinating on command net, etc. You don't have
time to deal with problem players or be the nicest person you can be.
This is simulated combat, survival of the simulated fittest.

A new round just started and you need to get a logistics truck and a
Stryker APC onto a strategic point on the map ASAP. You have 8
squadmates ready and waiting for your orders.

"I need a stryker crew. Who's got it?", You may ask.

Be prepared to hear crickets as nobody steps up to the plate. If this
happens, it's time to crack the whip.

"Cowboy\_98 and SH11V, spawn in as crewmember and grab the Stryker.
Everyone else, I need medics and LATs. Spawn main and jump in either my
logi or the Stryker. Double time, let's go!"

Now everybody's on the same page, there's no room for arguments on who
does what, and the game starts smoothly.

Later in the game, you may be tasked with defending a forward operating
base (FOB.) This can be a boring part of the game, but it's necessary to
retain controlpoints for your team.

"\|DoS\| Foggy, I need a logi run." A command often delegated to
squadmates after no volunteers offer their driving services.

"No man, I want to shoot." Says \|DoS\| Foggy.

"This is an order, soldier! This post needs ammo."

"Nah, I'm good."

\|DoS\| Foggy was thinking of themselves, not of the unit. Your squad
doesn't need that kind of luggage; that's a kick.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#4. Communicate early, communicate often.

I struggle with this one, but it's an imperative for highly functional
squad leaders. Communicate with your squad mates. Give spawn and
objective orders before they have to ask for them. Inform them of
need-to-know intel from command net.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#5. Do not give vehicles to lone wolves

You will see this over and over in Squad. Solo players wanting to drive
a Warrior or 30mm on their own into battle. The problem with this is
extreme, and I'll break it down.

Armored vehicles are not designed to be operated by one user. Switching
between driver and gunner seats takes several seconds, which means
several seconds of time needed to react with deadly force. This time can
be the difference between life and death in a vehicle team.

Armored vehicles are more likely to be destroyed when operated by one
user. A standard vehicle team is a minimum of three people\-- driver,
gunner, spotter. These three work together to eliminate blind spots and
detect threats, call out bearing and distance, and move quickly.

Armored vehicle loss incurs a hefty death ticket cost. Loss of these
tickets affects the entire team.

Solo players often communicate poorly. An effective vehicle team should
provide regular intel to the rest of their their squad regarding spotted
enemy FOBs, infantry, and other vehicles. Knowing where the enemy is is
what keeps the squad healthy.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#6. Treat armor with the utmost respect.

A vehicle can be the lifeforce of the squad. Take a Bradley fighting
vehicle for example. Should a squad choose to run one, that entire
squad's existence should revolve around that vehicle. The vehicle gives
infantry a break from walking long distances. The vehicle resupplies
ammunition. The vehicle provides cover from small arms. The vehicle's
weaponry is immensely powerful, and is an indispensable tool for
providing direct and suppressing fire when accomplishing objectives.

When driving a fighting vehicle in hostile areas, infantry should be on
foot, offering 360° coverage for a half kilometer around said vehicle.
It is this teamwork that will keep the Bradley combat effective, safe
against enemy RPGs, and able to play Uber for the wearied infantryman.

When a fighting vehicle becomes damaged, get the Hell out of dodge. Do
not stick around to take another round, return to base (RTB)
immediately. Don't think of that health bar as a health bar. Think of it
as a buffer against death. That buffer should be pegged at 100% at all
times.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#7. Use the map

Map markers are a non-verbal language that spans throughout the entire
team. With objective markers, your squad-mates know where you want them
without having to clog squad net. With enemy markers, they know where
the threats are, and can choose flanking or direct maneuvers when
approaching. This knowledge is effortlessly transmitted and interpreted
by other squads on your team.

\#\#\# Squad Leader Rule \#8. Use your optics.

Squad leaders have an often underappreciated tool, binoculars.
Binoculars can spot enemies from afar that the naked eye cannot. Holding
'T' to bring up your rose menu and set accurate enemy markers is a huge
plus. Spot for your team while they push, and call out those targets!

\#\# How Squad has changed my life

Squad has possibly been the most beneficial video game I have ever
played. I have improved my communication skills through Squad, by often
calling out bearings, distances, and relative terrain features when
spotting enemies. All these things together make for good callouts,
which isn't always easy to do when under fire.

I think there is something to say about the ability to think clearly
when under stress. It's a mind-over-matter type of activity that has AFK
applications. I'm getting better at it every day and I hope to continue
this trend.

A few months ago I sat down and thought long and hard about what I
wanted to do with my life. One of the things I came up with was that I
wanted to gain the freedom to be myself. This included things like
representing my beliefs and opinions accurately and honestly, even if
they were unpopular. Also, dropping F-Bombs when I felt like it. I have
been hesitant to do these things in the past for fear of offending
someone.

I value free speech highly, and with the goal of the above, I started
acting my true self when I played Squad. Squad can be a toxic, vile
place, with player's pent up hatred occasionally exploding and directed
at other individuals.

This may be counter-intuitive, but I have improved my self confidence by
playing Squad. I figured out that people are going to like me or dislike
me no matter what I do. In other words, I can either be afraid and be
hated, or I can be confident and hated. I'll be hated or liked by people
either way. This "law of attraction" is one source of my new found
confidence.

I've been trolled, berated and belittled while playing Squad. None of it
matters, since none of them were my friends. I have a circle of friends
who treat me very well, and those are the relationships which have
weight in my life. To take offense by something a rando said to me would
only give that rando power over me.

On the flip side, Squad has gifted me with a handful of friends that I
never would have found otherwise. Even if I haven't met these people
away from keyboard, these friendships are real, and I treasure them. I
would take a real bullet for these friends.
